# Dfci Sample Provider

This is a DXE driver that publishes the gDfciSettingsProviderSupportProtocolGuid protocol, which is a settings provider
for DFCI.

This is **not to be used in production** but is provided as a sample for reference when creating your own provider.

For more information, please refer to the DFCI documentation [here]( https://github.com/microsoft/mu_feature_dfci/tree/main/DfciPkg/Docs/PlatformIntegration/DfciSettingProviders/)
